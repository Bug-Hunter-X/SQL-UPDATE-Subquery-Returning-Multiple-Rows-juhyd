The correct approach uses a JOIN to update multiple rows based on conditions:

```sql
UPDATE employees
INNER JOIN salary_increases ON employees.employee_id = salary_increases.employee_id
SET employees.salary = salary_increases.salary * 1.10;
```

This method correctly updates the `salary` in the `employees` table by joining it with `salary_increases` table and applying the salary increase factor.  It avoids the issue of multiple rows returned by the subquery.
