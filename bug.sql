The following SQL query attempts to update multiple rows using a subquery that returns more than one row.  This violates the SQL standard, as an UPDATE statement with a subquery in the SET clause generally expects the subquery to return a single value.

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = (SELECT salary * 1.10 FROM salary_increases WHERE employee_id = employees.employee_id);
```

This will typically result in a syntax error or unexpected behavior depending on the specific database system.
